# Conduit Project 

Our Project would be implementing an API for a project similar to Medium, which will be called Conduit. This API will allow users to create and publish articles, follow other users, and interact with articles by commenting and favoriting them. The focus will be on the back-end functionality, with the front-end design and user interface to be handled separately. 

The Conduit API will be responsible for handling user authentication and authorization, so that users can securely create accounts and log in to the application. Once authenticated, users will be able to create, edit, and delete their own articles, as well as view and interact with articles created by other users.

The API will also allow users to follow other users and receive updates on their latest articles, as well as view and search for articles by tags and authors. Users will be able to comment on articles and see comments left by other users, and they will also be able to "favorite" articles to save them for later reading.

The API will be built using a RESTful architecture, with endpoints designed to handle all necessary CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. It will be designed to be scalable, with appropriate security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access or malicious activity.

The front-end design and user interface for Conduit will be handled separately, but the API will be designed to be easily integrated with a variety of front-end technologies, such as React or Vue.js.
